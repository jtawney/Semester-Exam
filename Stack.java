 * Stack with an array implementation
 * A Stack is a collect of data that has a "top" element.
 * Only the top element can be accessed.
 * When an element is added to the stack ("pushed"), the
 * new element becomes the top element.
 * 
 * This implmementaiton uses an array to store the data.
 * A stack has no limit to the number of elements that can
 * be added, but an array does, so you will have to think
 * about how to deal with the structure when the underlying
 * array is full, but a push() is called.
